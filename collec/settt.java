/*-----------------SET----------
 * it is a child interface of collection interface
 * this interface is implemented by using different classes(hashset and linked hashset)
 * insertion order not preserved 
 * duplicates are not allowed
 * ------------------hetero and nulls are allowed---------------------
 * 
 * 
 * ----HASHSET----
 * 
 * --hashset is a concept through which we add elements
 * --All the elements are arranged "unordered way"

 * -- in arraylist when the deafault size of arraylist fills it will create new object and all the elements are added to new object and new elemnts also
 * --whereas  in hashset as soon as the 75%of the arraylist fills the new object is created and vales are stored in it.
 * --when we have more search operations we have to go for this method beacuse it internally follows the hashcode method concept
 * 
 *  hashsheet doesnt have specific methods, it has methods of set(i) interface
 *  
 *  hashset hs=new hashset(100);
 *  hashset<integer>hs=new hashset<integer>();
 *  
 *  
 *  linkedhashset lh=new linkedhashset();
 *  linekdhashset<integer> lh=new linkedhashset();
 *
